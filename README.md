## How It Works

1. **API Integration:** The script pulls live data from news, weather, and to-do APIs.
2. **Email Automation:** Compiles the data into a friendly morning message and sends it to your Outlook email via SMTP.
3. **Python Anywhere Hosting:** The script can be hosted on PythonAnywhere for consistent daily updates.
